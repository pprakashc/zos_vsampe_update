# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing. A few simple guidelines:

- File issues for bugs or feature requests.
- Fork the repo and open a pull request for code changes.
- Keep changes small and focused; include a short description of intent.
- Add tests or reproduction steps when relevant.

If you want help onboarding, open an issue and tag it `help wanted`.
